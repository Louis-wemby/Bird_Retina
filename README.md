# Bird_Retina
This is a repository for my college graduation project (thesis) as well as part of an internship program at BGI, Shenzhen, focusing on the evolutionary mechanism of bird vision. My assignment is to explore the heterogeneity of retinal cells across several bird species with popular techniques wildly applied in spatial omics research.
